## About Me

I am Longge Yuan, a Master's student in Computer Science at **Florida State University (FSU)**, graduating in December 2025.  
My work spans **large language model optimization**, **streaming algorithms**, and **real-time intelligent monitoring systems**.

I am particularly interested in:

- **LLM pruning & efficient inference**  
- **System-level acceleration of deep models on consumer hardware**

## Research & Technical Work

### 🔹 DISP-LLM: Dimension-Independent Structural Pruning  
*Research Assistant to Prof. Shangqian Gao, FSU*  
I reproduced the DISP-LLM pruning method (NeurIPS 2024 submission) involving:

- Index-based residual bypassing  
- Hypernetwork-guided dynamic width selection  
- Pruning across OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and Phi architectures  
- Zero-shot evaluation under different pruning ratios  

This work contributed to the paper *“ToMoE: Converting Dense LLMs to Mixture-of-Experts through Dynamic Structural Pruning”*, Under review for TMLR.

### 🔹 Optimizing LLM Inference via TinyChat Engine  
*Course Project, Fall 2024*  
Designed system-level optimization for a quantized LLaMA-2 inference engine using a self-developed C++ runtime (TinyChat) on MacBook M3 Pro:

- Latency reduced from 12.4s → 1.4s/token (88.7% improvement)  
- Implemented custom operator fusion, memory scheduling, and cache-aware optimizations  
- Demonstrated applicability to other LLM architectures  

---

### 🔹 Scientific Data Compression Prediction  
*Course Project, Spring 2025*  
Built a model to predict lossy compression ratio for scientific field data:

- Extracted statistical and frequency-domain features (variance, Hurst exponent, energy ratios)  
- Trained Random Forest and XGBoost regressors  
- Evaluated on large datasets (Hurricane, XGC) using R² and MAE metrics
